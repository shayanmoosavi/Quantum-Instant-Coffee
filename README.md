## ðŸ’¡ About
Quantum Instant Coffee is a collection of Python scripts to easily generate a batch of all the needed input files for the most common [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) and [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/) calculations. The current supported calculations are:

- **Self-Consistent Field** (scf)
- **Projected Density of States** (pdos)
- **Projected Band Structure** (projected_bands)
- **Wannier interpolated bands** (wannier)

The input files will be generated with and without taking spin-orbit coupling into account and they will be placed in their respective directories.

Current toolkit:
- `init_calc.py`
- `plot_pbands.py`
- `plot_pdos.py` (coming soon)
- `compare_bands.py` (coming soon)

## ðŸ“– Usage
In order to use these scripts to generate the input files, you must first clone the repository in the main directory you want to generate input files. Then, run `init_calc.py` in the following way:

```bash
python init_calc.py <name-of-the-compound> <path-to-POSCAR-file>
```
POSCAR is a famous file format generally used by VASP software , which stores the lattice vectors and the atomic positions for a specified compound. The script will generate a folder named `<name-of-the-compound>` and in that folder it will create subfolders with the following structure:

```bash
```
